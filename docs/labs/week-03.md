# Week 3 ¬∑ ROS 2 (Humble) with Python

This week you‚Äôll learn how ROS 2 is organized and practice the core ideas you‚Äôll use all semester: **workspaces**, **packages**, **publish/subscribe**, and a tiny sim (**turtlesim**). The steps below point you to the **official Humble tutorials**‚Äîfollow them carefully.

## üéØ What you‚Äôll be able to do

- Set up a **ROS 2 workspace** and a **Python package** (Humble).
- Implement a basic **publisher** and **subscriber** and reason about **topics**.
- Use **CLI tools** and **rqt** to inspect nodes, topics, and messages.
- Control **turtlesim** by publishing velocity commands.

## üõ´ Part A ‚Äî Pre-flight check (5‚Äì10 min)

<!-- 1) Create a folder for this course (e.g., `~/enme480_ws`) to keep things tidy. -->
2) Using the commands form last week, open your Docker image contianing ROS
3) Open a new terminal and verify ROS 2 is available (e.g., `ros2 --version` or `ros2 --help`).  
4) Create a symlink into the docker container by opening a new terminal (while leaving the container open) and running:

```bash
docker exec <HIT TAB> ln -s ~/<NAME OF THE FOLDER YOU JUST MADE> ~/<NAME YOU WANT THE FOLDER TO HAVE INSIDE DOCKER> 
```
This will cause the folder you just created to appear inside the docker image, letting you work inside of it without deleting your work when the container closes. This is called a *symbolic link*. We will provide instrucitons on how to make this permanent soon, but for the time being you will need to rerun this command each time you restart the container.


**Checkpoint A (no submission yet):** You can run `ros2 --help` without errors.

## üì¶ Part B ‚Äî Workspace & package (setup only)

Follow the **official Humble tutorials** step-by-step (do not copy solution code from elsewhere):

1) **Create a workspace:** Use the **Create a workspace** guide and build once so the structure is valid.  
   ‚Ü™ Guide: [docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html)

2) **Create a Python package:** Inside your `src/`, make a new package for this week (any sensible name, e.g., `week3`).  
   ‚Ü™ Guide: [docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-Your-First-ROS2-Package.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-Your-First-ROS2-Package.html)

**Checkpoint B (screenshot later):** Your workspace builds with `colcon` and your package appears in the build output.

---

## üì° Part C ‚Äî Talker / Listener (no solution code here)

Use the **publisher/subscriber (Python)** tutorial as your primary reference:

- Tutorial: [docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Py-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Py-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html)

**Task C1 ‚Äî Publisher (‚Äútalker‚Äù)**  
Create a node that **publishes numbers at a steady rate** on a topic you choose (e.g., `/numbers`).  
*(Use the tutorial to recall how to create a publisher node; adapt it to publish numbers rather than strings.)*

**Task C2 ‚Äî Subscriber (‚Äúlistener‚Äù)**  
Create a node that **subscribes** to your numbers topic and **maintains a cumulative sum**. After each new message arrives, it should **publish the running sum** on a **new topic** (e.g., `/sum_topic`).  
*(Re-use the subscriber pattern from the tutorial; add your own sum logic and a second publisher.)*

**Task C3 ‚Äî Inspect with CLI**  
Use the **Understanding topics** tutorial to: **list topics**, **echo** your sum topic, and **show** topic info (type, publishers/subscribers).  
‚Ü™ [docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics.html)

> **Hints (conceptual, not solutions):**
> - Topic names must **match exactly**; message types must be consistent.  
> - If a terminal shows ‚Äúno publisher/subscriber‚Äù, confirm both nodes are running and your workspace is sourced.  
> - Keep node/topic names short and meaningful.

**Checkpoint C ‚Äî Screenshots to capture:**  
- Talker output (brief).  
- Listener output showing a **running sum**.  
- `ros2 topic list` and a short `ros2 topic echo` of your sum topic.

## üê¢ Part D ‚Äî Turtlesim (drive in a circle)

Read the **turtlesim, ros2, and rqt** tutorial first:  
[docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Introducing-Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Introducing-Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim.html)

**Task D1 ‚Äî Launch turtlesim**  
Start the turtlesim simulator in one terminal (see tutorial).

**Task D2 ‚Äî Velocity publisher**  
In your package, create a node that **publishes velocity commands** to turtlesim so the turtle moves in a **circle** (non-zero linear \(x\) and angular \(z\)).  
*(You‚Äôll find the correct topic name in the tutorial; use the CLI to explore message fields.)*

**Task D3 ‚Äî Observe & Inspect**  
Use `ros2 topic list` / `ros2 topic echo` to confirm motion and pose updates; open **rqt** and view the **Node Graph** and **Topic Monitor**.  
- rqt info: [docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/Intermediate/About-RQt.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/Intermediate/About-RQt.html)

**Checkpoint D ‚Äî Screenshots to capture:**  
- Turtlesim window with a **clear circular path**.  
- Your velocity publisher terminal (brief output).  
- `ros2 topic list` and a short `ros2 topic echo` of the pose topic.  
- rqt with **Node Graph** / **Topic Monitor** visible.

---

## üîé What we‚Äôre assessing

- You can follow **official Humble docs** and adapt examples to a new task.  
- Your nodes **publish/subscribe** correctly and use appropriate **topic names** and **message types**.  
- You can **inspect** systems via CLI and **rqt** and explain what you see.

---

## üì§ Deliverables (single PDF upload)

Include **concise** screenshots (one image may show multiple windows):

- **Talker/Listener:** talker output; listener output showing **running sum**; `ros2 topic list`; brief `ros2 topic echo` of your sum topic.  
- **Turtlesim:** turtlesim showing a **circle**; velocity publisher terminal; `ros2 topic list`; brief `ros2 topic echo` of the pose topic; rqt with Node Graph/Topic Monitor visible.  
- A terminal view of your **package tree** (folder/files) helps grading.

Also submit the **three Python files** you created this week as separate attachments or in the PDF appendix (clearly named).

---

## ‚úÖ Submission checklist

- [ ] Workspace builds with **colcon** (no errors).  
- [ ] Package exists in `src/` and is discoverable by `ros2 pkg list`.  
- [ ] Talker publishes numbers; listener computes & republishes a **running sum** to a new topic.  
- [ ] `ros2 topic list` shows your topics; `ros2 topic echo` shows expected messages.  
- [ ] Turtlesim moves in a **circle** when your node runs.  
- [ ] rqt screenshots show graph and topic activity.

---

## üí° Common pitfalls (where to look)

- **Nothing appears on a topic** ‚Üí check exact **topic names** and that both nodes are running; use `ros2 topic info` to inspect connections.  
- **Package found but nodes won‚Äôt run** ‚Üí review the **Create a package** tutorial for entry-point configuration and structure.  
- **rqt panels missing** ‚Üí install the rqt meta-packages (see turtlesim tutorial) and relaunch.
