# Week 3 · ROS 2 (Humble) with Python

This week you’ll learn how ROS 2 is organized and practice the core ideas you’ll use all semester: **workspaces**, **packages**, **publish/subscribe**, and a tiny sim (**turtlesim**). The steps below point you to the **official Humble tutorials**—follow them carefully.

## 🎯 What you’ll be able to do

- Set up a **ROS 2 workspace** and a **Python package** (Humble).
- Implement a basic **publisher** and **subscriber** and reason about **topics**.
- Use **CLI tools** and **rqt** to inspect nodes, topics, and messages.
- Control **turtlesim** by publishing velocity commands.

---

## 🛫 Part A — Pre-flight check (5–10 min)

1) Open a new terminal and verify ROS 2 is available (e.g., `ros2 --version` or `ros2 --help`).  
2) Create a folder for this course (e.g., `~/enme480_ws`) to keep things tidy.

**Checkpoint A (no submission yet):** You can run `ros2 --help` without errors.

---

## 📦 Part B — Workspace & package (setup only)

Follow the **official Humble tutorials** step-by-step (do not copy solution code from elsewhere):

1) **Create a workspace:** Use the **Create a workspace** guide and build once so the structure is valid.  
   ↪ Guide: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html

2) **Create a Python package:** Inside your `src/`, make a new package for this week (any sensible name, e.g., `week3`).  
   ↪ Guide: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-Your-First-ROS2-Package.html

**Checkpoint B (screenshot later):** Your workspace builds with `colcon` and your package appears in the build output.

---

## 📡 Part C — Talker / Listener (no solution code here)

Use the **publisher/subscriber (Python)** tutorial as your primary reference:

- Tutorial: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Py-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html

**Task C1 — Publisher (“talker”)**  
Create a node that **publishes numbers at a steady rate** on a topic you choose (e.g., `/numbers`).  
*(Use the tutorial to recall how to create a publisher node; adapt it to publish numbers rather than strings.)*

**Task C2 — Subscriber (“listener”)**  
Create a node that **subscribes** to your numbers topic and **maintains a cumulative sum**. After each new message arrives, it should **publish the running sum** on a **new topic** (e.g., `/sum_topic`).  
*(Re-use the subscriber pattern from the tutorial; add your own sum logic and a second publisher.)*

**Task C3 — Inspect with CLI**  
Use the **Understanding topics** tutorial to: **list topics**, **echo** your sum topic, and **show** topic info (type, publishers/subscribers).  
↪ https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics.html

> **Hints (conceptual, not solutions):**
> - Topic names must **match exactly**; message types must be consistent.  
> - If a terminal shows “no publisher/subscriber”, confirm both nodes are running and your workspace is sourced.  
> - Keep node/topic names short and meaningful.

**Checkpoint C — Screenshots to capture:**  
- Talker output (brief).  
- Listener output showing a **running sum**.  
- `ros2 topic list` and a short `ros2 topic echo` of your sum topic.

## 🐢 Part D — Turtlesim (drive in a circle)

Read the **turtlesim, ros2, and rqt** tutorial first:  
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Introducing-Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim.html

**Task D1 — Launch turtlesim**  
Start the turtlesim simulator in one terminal (see tutorial).

**Task D2 — Velocity publisher**  
In your package, create a node that **publishes velocity commands** to turtlesim so the turtle moves in a **circle** (non-zero linear \(x\) and angular \(z\)).  
*(You’ll find the correct topic name in the tutorial; use the CLI to explore message fields.)*

**Task D3 — Observe & Inspect**  
Use `ros2 topic list` / `ros2 topic echo` to confirm motion and pose updates; open **rqt** and view the **Node Graph** and **Topic Monitor**.  
- rqt info: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/Intermediate/About-RQt.html

**Checkpoint D — Screenshots to capture:**  
- Turtlesim window with a **clear circular path**.  
- Your velocity publisher terminal (brief output).  
- `ros2 topic list` and a short `ros2 topic echo` of the pose topic.  
- rqt with **Node Graph** / **Topic Monitor** visible.

---

## 🔎 What we’re assessing

- You can follow **official Humble docs** and adapt examples to a new task.  
- Your nodes **publish/subscribe** correctly and use appropriate **topic names** and **message types**.  
- You can **inspect** systems via CLI and **rqt** and explain what you see.

---

## 📤 Deliverables (single PDF upload)

Include **concise** screenshots (one image may show multiple windows):

- **Talker/Listener:** talker output; listener output showing **running sum**; `ros2 topic list`; brief `ros2 topic echo` of your sum topic.  
- **Turtlesim:** turtlesim showing a **circle**; velocity publisher terminal; `ros2 topic list`; brief `ros2 topic echo` of the pose topic; rqt with Node Graph/Topic Monitor visible.  
- A terminal view of your **package tree** (folder/files) helps grading.

Also submit the **three Python files** you created this week as separate attachments or in the PDF appendix (clearly named).

---

## ✅ Submission checklist

- [ ] Workspace builds with **colcon** (no errors).  
- [ ] Package exists in `src/` and is discoverable by `ros2 pkg list`.  
- [ ] Talker publishes numbers; listener computes & republishes a **running sum** to a new topic.  
- [ ] `ros2 topic list` shows your topics; `ros2 topic echo` shows expected messages.  
- [ ] Turtlesim moves in a **circle** when your node runs.  
- [ ] rqt screenshots show graph and topic activity.

---

## 💡 Common pitfalls (where to look)

- **Nothing appears on a topic** → check exact **topic names** and that both nodes are running; use `ros2 topic info` to inspect connections.  
- **Package found but nodes won’t run** → review the **Create a package** tutorial for entry-point configuration and structure.  
- **rqt panels missing** → install the rqt meta-packages (see turtlesim tutorial) and relaunch.
