# Labs

Studios/Labs are group-based and alternate between programming studios (**KEB 2111**) and robot time (**EAF 3119**). Safety training is required before robot access. Follow **Piazza** for location updates.

Use the week pages on the left for objectives, setup, and deliverables. Lab code is tracked in the **Lab-Code** submodule.
