# Week 3 - Introduction to ROS (Robot Operating System)

## Overview
Introduction to ROS (Robot Operating System), the fundamental framework for robotics development and simulation.

## Materials
- [ENME480_IntroToROS.pdf](ENME480_IntroToROS.pdf) - Comprehensive introduction to ROS concepts and usage

## Key Topics
- **ROS Fundamentals**: Understanding the Robot Operating System architecture
- **Core Concepts**: Nodes, topics, services, and actions
- **Communication**: How ROS components communicate with each other
- **Development Workflow**: Building and running ROS applications

## Learning Objectives
- Understand ROS architecture and philosophy
- Learn basic ROS concepts (nodes, topics, services)
- Set up ROS development environment
- Create simple ROS programs

## Prerequisites
- Week 2: Ubuntu and Python basics
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

## ROS Concepts Covered
- **Nodes**: Individual processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Asynchronous communication mechanism
- **Services**: Synchronous request-response communication
- **Messages**: Data structures for communication
- **Packages**: Organizational units for ROS code

## Next Steps
This ROS foundation will enable you to work with Gazebo simulation in Week 4.
