## Course Description
This course introduces elementary concepts in robotics with integrated theory and lab components. Labs emphasize interdisciplinary teamwork, developing and testing code on **UR3e** robotic arms across programming studios and hands-on lab sections.

## Learning Outcomes
- Apply mathematics, science, and engineering to robotics problems  
- Analyze and interpret experimental data  
- Use robot geometry for kinematics analysis  
- Apply robot dynamics for planning and control

## Required Resources
- **Course website:** ELMS-Canvas  
- **Textbook:** *Robot Modeling and Control* (2e), Spong, Hutchinson, Vidyasagar, 2020, ISBN 978-1119523994  
- **Hardware/Software:** Laptop capable of running **ROS 2** (setup guided in labs)

## Course Structure
- **Lectures & in-class assignments:** Short comprehension questions (extra credit) may be assigned after lectures.  
- **Studios & Labs:** Run by TAs in **KEB 2111** (programming) and **EAF 3119** (Robotics & Autonomy Lab). Safety seminar + online training required before using robots.  
- **Homework:** Posted Fridays 11:59 pm; due one week later via Canvas. Extensions via Piazza only (solutions release soon after deadlines).  
- **Exams:** Two midterms (see Schedule). One page of notes (front/back) permitted.  
- **Final Project:** Vision-enabled pick-and-place with UR3e: locate blocks, grasp, and build a tower. Group project with write-up and video.

## Communication & Participation
- **Piazza is official** for course questions; Canvas hosts materials/announcements.  
- Professional, inclusive discussion is expected in all channels and sessions.  
- Attendance and on-time arrival for studios/labs are essential; coordinate via Piazza if you must miss your assigned session.

## Policies (Summary)
- **Academic Integrity:** The University’s Code applies; collaboration on graded work is prohibited unless stated. Unauthorized use of course-assistance sites or AI-generated solutions is not permitted. Pledge required on each assignment/exam.  
- **AI Usage (Course-specific):** Brainstorming/review OK; final work must be your own. **Do not run AI-generated code on physical robots.**  
- **Accessibility & Accommodations:** See ADS; contact instructor promptly for arrangements.  
- **Campus resources:** Emergency Preparedness, Basic Needs, Veteran Resources, Title IX, Course Evaluation—see Policies page.
