## üíª **Choose Your Platform**

=== "macOS (Apple Silicon) ‚Äî UTM VM"

    ### **Step 1: Download UTM**
    
    Download UTM from the official website: <https://mac.getutm.app>

    ### **Step 2: Download Ubuntu 22.04 ARM64**
    
    Get Ubuntu 22.04 ARM64 (Desktop or Server): <https://cdimage.ubuntu.mirror.onlime.sl/ubuntu/daily-live/20220417/>  
    *Choose **22.04 LTS 64-bit (ARM)**.*

    ### **Step 3: Create New Virtual Machine**
    
    Open UTM and you'll see the welcome screen with options to create a new virtual machine, browse the gallery, or access user guides.
    
    ![UTM Download](assets/vm_figs/1.webp)
    
    Choose [Virtualize] then [Linux], choose your downloaded iso image file, and click [Continue] with all of the boxes unchecked.

    ![Ubuntu Download](assets/vm_figs/2.webp)
    
    ![Create VM](assets/vm_figs/3.webp)
    
    Click on Browse and select the ISO file you downloaded in Step 2
    
    ![Choose Virtualization](assets/vm_figs/4.webp)

    On the next screen, leave the memory at 4096 MB and CPU Cores at [Default]. Then specify the amount of space you want to allocate to the virtual machine. It is recommended that you don‚Äôt go below around 30GB. Leaving it at the default 64GB is fine, or allocate a higher number if you prefer. Preferred space is around 50GB

    ![Select Linux](assets/vm_figs/5.webp)
    
   
    ![Browse ISO](assets/vm_figs/6.webp)
    
    (Optional) Here you can select a storage location for the VM or just leave it as is. This is to configure a shared directory to make files accessible between macOS and your Ubuntu VM. Click "Browse..." to select a folder.
    
    ![System Settings](assets/vm_figs/7.webp)

    Once done, enter the details for your VM as you want and press done.

    ### **Step 4: Start the VM**
    
    Click the play button to start your virtual machine. You'll see the GRUB boot menu where you can select "Try or Install Ubuntu".

    ![Display Settings](assets/vm_figs/8.webp)

    
    ![Review Settings](assets/vm_figs/9.png)

    ### **Step 11: Ubuntu Installation Welcome**
    
    The below window will be shown and once done, open up "Install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS". The Ubuntu installer will start and show the welcome screen. Select your language and click "Continue".

    ![Start VM](assets/vm_figs/10.png)

   
    
    ![Installation Welcome](assets/vm_figs/11.png)
    
     Choose your keyboard layout. "English (US)" is selected by default. You can test your keyboard in the text field below. (Normally, you can leave it as is and just press continue)
    
    ![Installation Type](assets/vm_figs/12.png)
    
    Uncheck the "Download updates while installing" so that you have a faster installation
    
    ![User Setup](assets/vm_figs/13.png)

     Select "Erase disk and install Ubuntu" since this is a virtual machine. The installer will show a warning about deleting all files.

    
    ![Installation Progress](assets/vm_figs/14.png)
    
    ![Installation Complete](assets/vm_figs/15.png)
    
    ![Ubuntu Login](assets/vm_figs/16.png)

    Enter the details you want and press "Continue". The installer will copy files and install Ubuntu. This process may take several minutes depending on your system performance.

    ![Ubuntu Desktop](assets/vm_figs/17.png)

    Once installation is complete, you'll see the "Installation Complete" screen. Click "Restart Now" to finish the setup.

    ### **Step 6: First Boot**
    
    After restart, you'll see the Ubuntu login screen. Enter your username and password to log in.
    


    
    You'll be greeted with the Ubuntu desktop environment with the default jellyfish wallpaper. The dock on the left contains common applications.

=== "Windows ‚Äî WSL 2 (Ubuntu 22.04)"

    1. Open **Terminal** (Win+X ‚Üí *Terminal* or search ‚Äúterminal‚Äù).  
    2. Install Ubuntu 22.04:

        ```powershell
        wsl --install Ubuntu-22.04
        ```

        This installs the exact distro we use. Using a different Ubuntu version often breaks ROS compatibility.

    3. After reboot, you‚Äôll land in the Ubuntu shell (or run `wsl`).  
       **Disk space:** at least **35 GB** free (recommend **50‚Äì60 GB**).  

=== "Linux / Dual-boot (optional)"

    Ubuntu 22.04 LTS native install is fine if you prefer dual-boot. Ensure disk space ‚â• **60 GB**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Post-Installation Setup**

Open up Terminal using `Ctrl + Alt + T` or from the menu on the bottom left and selecting it.

### **Step 1: Update System**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### **Step 2: Install Essential Tools**
```bash
# Development tools
sudo apt install build-essential cmake git curl wget

# Python tools
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv

# Text editors
sudo apt install code  # VS Code
sudo apt install gedit  # Simple text editor

# Docker
sudo snap install docker

```

### **Step 3: Configure Python**
```bash
# Create virtual environment for robotics work
python3 -m venv ~/robotics_env
source ~/robotics_env/bin/activate

# Install common packages
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

### **Step 4: Configure Docker to Run as Non-Root User**

If you want to run Docker as a non-root user, then you need to add your user to the docker group.

Create the docker group if it does not exist:
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```
Add your user to the docker group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
Log in to the new docker group (to avoid having to log out and log in again; but if not enough, try to reboot):
```bash
newgrp docker
```
Check if Docker can be run without root:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
Reboot if you still get an error:
```bash
reboot
```

## ENME480 Docker Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repo

Open up [MRC's ENME480 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MarylandRoboticsCenter/ENME480_mrc). You can either download the zip or open up your terminal

```bash
cd 
git clone https://github.com/MarylandRoboticsCenter/ENME480_mrc.git
```

This will download the repository content into your `HOME` directory. Next, build Docker image (run the command from the docker folder). This needs to be done every time the Docker file is changed. Here's the commands to do that:

**For MacOS users**, change Line no. 4 in the docker file `humble-enme480_ur3e.Dockerfile` 

```
# BEFORE
FROM osrf/ros:humble-desktop AS humble-mod_desktop

# AFTER
FROM arm64v8/ros:humble AS humble-mod_desktop
```

### Step 2: Build and Run the Docker

**For Everyone**, run

```bash
cd ~/ENME480_mrc/docker/
userid=$(id -u) groupid=$(id -g) docker compose -f humble-enme480_ur3e-nvidia-compose.yml build
```

Once it is successfully built, run the container

```bash
docker compose -f humble-enme480_ur3e-compose.yml run --rm enme480_ur3e-docker
```
